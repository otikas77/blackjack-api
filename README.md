# Blackjack Game Rules

## Overview

Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. The game is also known as 21 due to its primary metric, where players attempt to build a hand that equals or is close to 21 without exceeding it. In this document, we will go over the rules of the Blackjack game.

## Game Rules

1. **Dealing Cards** - Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer receives one face-up card and one face-down card.

2. **Scoring Hands** - The point total of a hand is determined by the sum of the card values. The player with the highest total wins the round as long as it doesn't exceed 21. Going over 21 results in a "bust."

3. **Card Values** - Cards numbered 2 through 10 have a value equal to their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points. The value of an Ace can be either 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's hand. An Ace is worth 11 points unless it would cause the player to bust, in which case it is valued at 1 point.

4. **Additional Cards** - Players can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand) to get as close to 21 as possible without busting.

5. **Winning the Game** - The player with the highest hand total that doesn't bust wins the round. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
